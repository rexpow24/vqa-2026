# Architecture — Vietnamese Traffic Clip Dataset Pipeline

**Status:** implemented, verified end-to-end on real footage · **Updated:** 2026-08-29

Governed by [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md). Where this document and the constitution
disagree, the constitution wins.

---

## 1. Objective & scope

Turn YouTube compilations from Vietnamese traffic channels into short, clean,
single-incident clips on local disk, ready for later VQA annotation.

**In scope:** download → segment → redact overlays → human review → export.

**Phase 2, added 2026-09-05:** VLM-assisted QA annotation — `vlm/` and `docker/`. See §15.

**Out of scope, deliberately:** Google Drive or any cloud
storage, multi-machine coordination, formal boundary benchmarks, threshold
tuning campaigns.

---

## 2. Source material — what the footage actually looks like

Measured on `KdhIs56QWuQ` (*Camera giao thông*, "Bad driving [P314]"):

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Duration | 12 min (some are ~60 min) |
| Resolution / fps | 1920×1080, 30fps |
| Segments | ~35, separated by hard cuts |
| Segment length | 5–58s |

Every frame carries burned-in overlays, but **not the same ones**:

| Overlay | Position | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Channel logo "CAMERA Giao thông" | top-right | present always, **alpha-blended** |
| Source clock | top-left (CCTV) *or* bottom-left (dashcam) | present always, digits change every second |
| Compilation counter `#03` | bottom-left | **transient** — a few seconds per segment |
| Source-camera name "Yen Hoa 1" | bottom-right | present on some segments only |

Source footage is heterogeneous within one compilation: fixed CCTV and dashcam
material are interleaved, which is why overlay positions move.

### Why these facts drive the design

1. **The logo is alpha-blended.** The scene shows through it, so no pixel is ever
   truly static. Measured temporal-variance floor inside the logo box: **258**.
   A static-overlay detector using an absolute threshold of 18 finds *nothing*.
2. **The counter is transient.** It is absent from most frames, so per-pixel
   temporal variance can never classify it as a static region.
3. **Overlay positions vary by source.** No single fixed rectangle covers the
   clock, the counter and the camera name.

---

## 3. System architecture

```

          ▼                       │
   logs/latest.log ───────────────┘
```

### Why a subprocess and not a direct call

Streamlit re-runs its entire script on every widget interaction. A pipeline
running inside that script would be killed and restarted by any click. So the
pipeline is a separate process; the app watches SQLite and the log file.

SQLite is in **WAL** mode with `busy_timeout=30000`, so the app reads while the
subprocess writes.

---

## 4. Configuration

One `config.json`, written **only** by the Streamlit sidebar. No CLI flags, no
manual editing.

| Group | Keys |
|---|---|
| Toggles | `review_enabled`, `blur_enabled`, `color_kill_enabled` |
| Overlay removal | `blur_sigma`, `desaturate`, `darken`, `fixed_blur[]` |
| Detection | `content_threshold` |
| Clip policy | `min_duration_s`, `max_duration_s`, `safety_trim_frames` |
| Encoding | `encoder`, `nvenc_cq`, `libx264_crf` |
| Paths | `work_dir`, `output_dir` |
| Download | `max_height`, `cookies_file`, `cookies_browser` |

`config_hash()` is the first 8 chars of the SHA-256 of the sorted config. Every
clip records the hash of the config that produced it; the export manifest records
the hash at export time. They can differ, and the field names say so.

Settings are **locked during a run**, so one batch cannot span two configs.

---

## 5. Pipeline stages

| # | Stage | Cache file | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | enqueue | `videos` row | video ID is the dedup key |
| S2 | download | `source.mp4`, `metadata.json` | yt-dlp + cookies + JS runtime |
| S3 | probe | `probe.json` | rejects anything under 30s |
| S4 | calibrate | `channels` row | **per channel**, not per video |
| S5 | shot detection | `shots.json` | PySceneDetect `ContentDetector` |
| S6 | boundaries → clips | `boundaries.json` | clip policy + blank filter |
| S7 | cut masters | `clips/*.mp4` | lossless `-c copy` |
| S8 | blur + encode | `delivered/*.mp4` | NVENC, libx264 fallback |
| S9 | **reviewer approve** | `trimmed/*.mp4` | **not** part of the automated run |

### S2 — Download

YouTube bot-gates most IPs. Two things are required and both are in the yt-dlp
options:

- **Cookies** — `cookies_file` accepts Netscape `.txt` or extension `.json`;
  JSON is converted on the fly and cached by mtime.
- **JS runtime** — `js_runtimes: {"deno": {}, "node": {}}` plus
  `remote_components: ["ejs:github"]`. YouTube's "n" challenge needs a real JS
  engine and yt-dlp's solver script; without both, extraction fails with
  `The page needs to be reloaded`.

> `ejs:github` fetches and executes a solver script from GitHub at run time.
> That is yt-dlp's official mechanism and there is currently no offline
> alternative, but it is third-party code running locally — worth knowing.

### S4 — Overlay calibration (per channel, cached)

Per-pixel temporal variance over ~300 sampled frames at 480px wide.

The "static" cutoff is **relative**, not absolute:

```python
cutoff = max(VAR_MAX, percentile(var, VAR_PCT))   # VAR_MAX=18, VAR_PCT=1.0
```

Real branding is alpha-blended, so an absolute threshold finds nothing. But
overlay pixels are still ~4× steadier than scene pixels, and the steadiest 1% of
the frame is overwhelmingly overlay: **97.8% of selected pixels fell inside the
logo box** on real footage. `VAR_MAX` stays as a floor so an opaque overlay
behaves exactly as before.

Candidate boxes are then filtered by area, by sitting in the outer 25% of the
frame, and by having real spatial detail (flat sky and road are rejected).

Because this measures *motion*, it cannot mask a licence plate or a road sign —
those move. A learned text detector absolutely would.

### S5 — Shot detection

PySceneDetect `ContentDetector` at defaults, `auto_downscale = True`.
**This is the only segmentation signal.**

---

## 6. Segmentation — one signal, honestly labelled

An earlier design fused visual cuts with counter-change detection, routing
agreement to `HIGH` confidence. **That path was removed after testing against
real footage.**

The counter exists — the yellow `#03` at bottom-left — but it is transient, so
temporal variance cannot find it. Worse, when calibration *did* latch onto the
alpha-blended logo and label it "counter", that region changed **whenever the
scene behind it changed**. Measured change rate: logo `0.244` vs a pure-scene
control `0.000`.

A counter derived from scene bleed-through is not an independent signal. Fusing
it with PySceneDetect would have produced `HIGH` confidence from **one signal
wearing two hats** — confidence that looks earned and isn't.

So: one signal, every boundary `MEDIUM`, and review order driven by clip duration
instead. This is a real capability loss, recorded here rather than papered over.

### Clip policy

```
edges  = [0] + boundaries + [duration]
start  = edge + safety_trim   (except the first)
end    = next_edge - safety_trim
```

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `duration < min_duration_s` | dropped |
| `duration > max_duration_s` | kept, flagged `TOO_LONG` — never auto-split |
| mean luma `< 12` | dropped, logged as `black` |
| inter-frame motion `< 0.25` | dropped, logged as `static` |

The blank filter catches title cards and bumpers. The motion floor is
deliberately low: a real traffic clip can be a genuinely quiet street at night.
Drops are **counted and logged**, never silent.

---

## 7. Overlay removal

Two layers, both applied, both into one ffmpeg `filter_complex`:

1. **Calibrated regions** (S4) — whatever branding is static enough to find.
2. **Fixed bands** — `fixed_blur[]` from config, as fractions of the frame,
   applied to **every** video. These cover the clock, the counter and the camera
   name, which S4 structurally cannot see. Defaults: `bottom_left`, `top_left`,
   `bottom_right`.

Per region: `crop → gblur → [hue → eq] → overlay`.

Two ffmpeg details that cost real debugging time:

- **`gblur`, not `boxblur`.** boxblur's radius is capped by the chroma plane size
  and fails outright on small regions.
- **Explicit `split=2` per region.** Each stage needs the same frame twice — as
  the overlay base and as the crop source. Reusing one label for both silently
  drops every overlay but the last, with no ffmpeg error. It was caught only by
  measuring per-region pixel variance before and after.

### Verified effect

| Region | Master | Delivered |
|---|---|---|
| Logo | std 79.59 | std 18.83 (**−76.3%**) |
| Roadway control, same size | std 17.71 | std 17.68 (−0.2%) |

Blur removes *legibility*, not *presence*. Pixels under a composited overlay are
never revealed in any frame, so no method can recover them. Desaturate + darken
removes the brand colour signature.

---

## 8. Data model

```sql
channels(channel_id PK, name, overlay_regions, calibrated_at)
videos(youtube_video_id PK, canonical_url, title, channel_id, duration_s,
       status, stage, error_code, error_detail, retry_count,
       config_snapshot, n_clips, n_boundaries, created_at, updated_at)
clips(clip_id PK, youtube_video_id, seq, start_ms, end_ms, duration_ms,
      confidence, flags, master_path, delivered_path,
      pipeline_version, config_hash, trim_segments, created_at)
reviews(clip_id PK, decision, reviewed_at)
```

### Clip ID is content-derived

```
{video_id}_{start_ms:06d}_{end_ms:06d}
```

Same input plus same config ⇒ same ID. That gives idempotent re-runs and safe
merges for free, with no ID allocator.

### `trim_segments` is JSON, not columns

```json
[{"start_ms": 4000, "end_ms": 9000, "path": "work/.../trimmed/..._t01.mp4"}]
```

One clip can produce several output files, so a fixed set of trim columns does
not fit. `insert_clip` is an **UPSERT**, not `INSERT OR REPLACE` — a replace
drops the whole row and would wipe the reviewer's work on every re-run.

### Three tiers of artifact

| Folder | Written by | Modified? |
|---|---|---|
| `clips/` | pipeline, lossless | never |
| `delivered/` | pipeline, blurred | re-encoded on re-run |
| `trimmed/` | **reviewer, on Approve** | replaced on re-approve, deleted on Reject |

`trimmed/` is the finished product. When `delivered/` is re-encoded, any existing
approved segments are **re-cut from the new file**, so a blur-settings change can
never leave stale output in the deliverable.

---

## 9. States

```
QUEUED → DOWNLOADING → PROCESSING → READY_FOR_REVIEW → (reviewed)
   ↑          ↓             ↓
   │  DOWNLOAD_FAILED    FAILED        ← both retryable from the Queue tab
   │          ↓             ↓
   └────────STOPPED ←───────┘          ← Stop, or a crash left it in-flight
```

`STOPPED` exists because `proc.terminate()` used to be the whole of Stop. The
row the runner was working on stayed at `DOWNLOADING`/`PROCESSING` forever:
`next_queued()` would not pick it up, neither retry button saw it, and removal
refused it — stranded from all four paths at once.

`db.mark_stopped()` moves every in-flight row to `STOPPED`. It must run **after
the process has actually exited**, not merely after `terminate()`: the runner
writes status too, and a dying one will overwrite `STOPPED` with the stage it
was in. The Stop button therefore `proc.wait(timeout=10)`s, escalating to
`kill()`.

Stop cannot reach a row stranded by a crash, a reboot or a closed browser tab —
it is disabled when this session holds no subprocess. The Queue tab offers a
separate **Mark them STOPPED** button for that case. Deliberately manual: this
session's `busy` flag says nothing about a run started from another tab, so
automatic reconciliation could mark a genuinely running video as stopped.

Headless runs end at `DONE` with clips marked `UNREVIEWED` — never `APPROVED`,
and nothing is written to `trimmed/`. A headless batch must not be able to pass
as a reviewed one.

Clip decisions: `UNREVIEWED` → `APPROVED` | `REJECTED` | `FLAGGED`.

### Removing a URL from the queue

`db.REMOVABLE` is `QUEUED`, `DOWNLOAD_FAILED`, `FAILED`, `STOPPED` — the states
the runner is finished with. `READY_FOR_REVIEW` and `DONE` are not removable:
their clips are the product.

`clips` has no foreign key back to `videos`, so `db.remove_video()` deletes the
`clips` and `reviews` rows itself. The first three states never own clips, but
`STOPPED` can: the pipeline inserts one clip per iteration of the encode loop,
so a video killed halfway through has some.

Rows are not the whole story. Clips become reviewable as soon as they are
encoded — the reviewer does not wait for the run to finish — so a `STOPPED`
video may already own `APPROVED` files in `trimmed/`. **Use
`review.purge_video()`, not `db.remove_video()`**: it collects those paths
first, deletes the rows, and only unlinks the files if the row actually went, so
a refusal leaves the disk untouched.

The status test lives **inside the DELETE**, not in the caller. `run_pipeline.py`
is a separate process reading the same table, so a row can move from `QUEUED` to
`DOWNLOADING` between the moment the app renders the picker and the moment the
button is clicked. The UI additionally disables removal during a run, matching
the two retry buttons.

Nothing on disk is touched. A part-downloaded `source.part` survives, so
re-adding the URL resumes rather than restarting — and a complete
`source.mp4` + `metadata.json` pair means `download.download()` returns the
cached metadata without calling yt-dlp at all.

---

## 10. Review

Order is **duration-based**, because with one detection signal confidence carries
no information:

| Band | Rule |
|---|---|
| `TOP` | `duration_ms > 15000` |
| `LOW` | otherwise |

TOP drains first, then LOW begins automatically. Priority comes from the
**original** duration and never changes when a reviewer trims.

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Approve** | cuts the defined segments from `delivered/` into `trimmed/` |
| **Reject** | deletes this clip's files from `trimmed/`, nothing else |
| **Flag** | records a decision, advances, writes nothing |

There is no Skip. A decision is required to advance.

### Trim geometry (`vqa/trim.py`)

The reviewer defines up to **3 shots** per clip, each becoming one file. The
geometry rules live in `trim.py` rather than `app.py` so they can be exercised
without starting Streamlit:

| Function | Rule |
|---|---|
| `apply_mark(shots, dur, x, pad)` | Mark cut end-to-end: replaces an untouched default, calls `mark_cut`, refuses past `MAX_SHOTS`. Returns the new shot list, or `None`. |
| `append_shot(shots, dur, pad)` | Add shot end-to-end: replaces an untouched default, places the new shot at the previous one's end (or 0), refuses past `MAX_SHOTS`. Returns the new shot list, or `None`. |
| `mark_cut(x, dur, others, pad)` | `x ± pad`, shrinking `pad → pad-1 → … → 1s` until it clears the clip edges and every other shot. `None` when even ±1s cannot fit. The geometry `apply_mark` builds on. |
| `resolve(shots, i, dur)` | same ladder applied to one existing shot, around its own centre. Returns the new shot list, or `None` when it is buried inside another. Does not mutate `shots`. |
| `reshape(shot, start, end)` | rebuilds one shot at new Start/End, clearing `auto`/`default` if the numbers actually moved — a manual edit is a manual decision. |
| `conflicts(shots)` | overlapping pairs and the region they share. Under `OVERLAP_TOL = 0.1s` is rounding noise, not a conflict. |
| `errors(shots, dur)` | everything blocking Approve: conflicts, inverted shots, out-of-range shots. |
| `timeline_html(shots, dur)` | the whole clip as a bar, one colour per shot, overlaps in red. Plain HTML+CSS via `st.markdown`. |

`apply_mark`/`append_shot`/`resolve`/`reshape` are the only functions `app.py`
calls from the Review tab; every mutation decision (replace-vs-extend,
auto-shrink, MAX_SHOTS, clearing `auto`/`default` on a manual edit) lives here,
not in the button handlers. `app.py` calls one function per handler and either
`_set()`s the result or shows the error — no shot-list rule is inlined in
`app.py` itself. This is what makes the module deep: a small interface (four
functions) in front of every rule the Review tab enforces, all of it reachable
by `pytest` with no Streamlit involved.

Three design points worth stating:

- **Shrink evenly, never one-sided.** The clip stays centred on the impact, so
  an auto-adjusted clip is still a valid answer to "what happened here".
- **Refuse rather than emit a sliver.** Below ±1s the tool stops and says so.
  A 0.4s clip is worse than no clip, and the reviewer can always type times.
- **The first Mark cut (or Add shot) replaces the whole-clip default.**
  Otherwise every new shot would collide with the shot the reviewer was handed
  on arrival. Enforced once, inside `apply_mark`/`append_shot`, not at each
  call site.

A shot is a plain dict (`start`, `end`, `auto`, `default`) so it survives
`st.session_state` unchanged. `auto` drives the yellow marker; `default` marks
the untouched arrival state. Re-approving replaces the previous segments, so
shrinking the shot count never leaves orphans.

The timeline is HTML in `st.markdown`, not a custom component: a component
would mean a JS build step, which `CLAUDE.md` rules out. The cost is that
blocks cannot be dragged — numbers are typed into 0.1s-step inputs instead.

Reject is recoverable by construction: it touches only the finished-product
folder. The master, the delivered clip and the download all survive.

The cut rule reviewers follow (impact → impact+5s) lives in
[`GUIDE.md` §2.4](./GUIDE.md), not here — it is dataset policy, not architecture.

---

## 11. Export

`export/<batch>/clips/<video_id>/` plus `manifest.json`, one entry per **file**
(a clip with 3 segments yields 3 entries) carrying clip ID, segment index, trim
points, priority, confidence, flags, decision, pipeline version and config hash.

`review_mode` in the manifest records `interactive` vs `headless`.

---

## 12. Performance & disk

12-minute 1080p video, RTX-class GPU:

| Stage | Time |
|---|---|
| download | ~30s |
| calibration | ~2 min (per channel) |
| shot detection | ~8 min |
| cut + blur + encode | ~3 min |

| Artifact | Size |
|---|---|
| `source.mp4` | 149 MB |
| `clips/` (35 masters) | 627 MB |
| `delivered/` at `cq=23` | 608 MB |
| **per video** | **~1.4 GB** |
| **50 videos** | **~70 GB** |

`cq` was 19 originally, which produced 905 MB of delivered — about 6× the
lossless masters. 23 is visually equivalent and 33% smaller.

---

## 13. Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI | Streamlit (single process) |
| Runner | `subprocess.Popen` + SQLite polling |
| State | SQLite (WAL) |
| Download | yt-dlp |
| Segmentation | PySceneDetect `ContentDetector` |
| Video | ffmpeg / ffprobe |
| Arrays | numpy, OpenCV |
| Tests | pytest + `streamlit.testing.v1.AppTest` (`tests/`, dev-only) |

Explicitly rejected: FastAPI, React/Next.js, Celery/Redis, an ORM, PaddleOCR or
any OCR, TransNetV2, deep video inpainting, optical flow, cloud storage.

### Polling without hijacking the app

Streamlit executes **every tab's body in one script run**. The Run tab used to
end with `time.sleep(2); st.rerun()`, which therefore re-created the Review
tab's `st.video` element every two seconds — a reviewer could not watch a clip
while the pipeline ran, and the whole app stalled 2s before the Review tab was
even reached. `AppTest` never terminated.

Progress, the counters and the log now live in an `st.fragment(run_every=2)`,
which reruns only itself. Two consequences worth knowing:

- `busy` is computed once at the top of the script and nothing recomputes it
  any more, so the fragment calls `st.rerun(scope="app")` once when it sees the
  subprocess has exited. Without that, a finished run leaves the sidebar locked.
- The log is `st.code`, not `st.text_area`. A keyed text area would pin the
  first read forever — Streamlit ignores `value=` once the key exists. The log
  is output, not input.

---

## 13b. Windows asyncio teardown

`vqa/winasyncio.py` patches `_ProactorBasePipeTransport._call_connection_lost`.
CPython calls `socket.shutdown()` there without a guard, so a browser tab close,
a page refresh or an aborted `st.video` range request raises
`ConnectionResetError` (WinError 10054) **and skips the four teardown lines that
follow it** — the socket is never closed and the server never detaches the
transport. The exception surfaces inside the event loop's callback, where no
application `try/except` can reach it, so wrapping the transport method is the
only option. The patch swallows only `ConnectionReset`/`ConnectionAborted`,
finishes the teardown by hand, and is idempotent because Streamlit re-executes
the script on every interaction.

---

## 14. Known limitations (accepted, not problems to solve now)

1. **Every boundary is `MEDIUM`.** One signal. Every clip needs a human.
2. **Blur is destructive and approximate.** Fixed bands blur whatever sits under
   them, including a little roadway.
3. **Overlays are obscured, not removed.** Nothing can recover pixels that were
   never visible.
4. **No near-duplicate detection.** Compilations re-use footage across uploads.
   → **Must be revisited before drawing any train/test split.** The same incident
   landing in both splits would invalidate the dataset.
5. **Calibration is channel-scoped.** A channel that changes its layout
   mid-catalogue needs its cached row cleared.
6. **`remote_components: ejs:github`** executes third-party JS fetched at
   download time.
7. **Trim re-encodes an already-encoded file.** Generation loss, negligible at
   `cq=23`. Cutting from masters and re-blurring would avoid it, at a few seconds
   per trim.

---

## 15. Phase 2 — the VLM annotation path

Added 2026-09-05, verified end to end on real clips the same day.

```
vlm/scripts/test_api.py

   ├── vlm/select.py                                 4 times around the middle

   └──▶ vlm/data/output/*.jsonl        the only thing this path writes
```

**One-way dependency.** `vlm/` imports `vqa/`; `vqa/` never imports `vlm/`. Deleting
`vlm/` entirely leaves the clip pipeline and its 55 original tests untouched.

**Why the database is read-only.** `run_pipeline.py` and the Streamlit reviewer already
contend over `pipeline.db`, and every serious bug in §14's history came from a second
writer. `vlm/source.py` opens it `file:...?mode=ro`, and `tests/test_vlm_isolation.py`
fails the build if write SQL ever appears under `vlm/`.

**Why records key on `clip_id + shot + sha256`, never a path.** `review.discard()` deletes
from `trimmed/` when the reviewer rejects a clip, and `review.purge_video()` deletes when a
video leaves the queue. A stored path silently starts pointing at nothing. Keying on the
clip and hashing the file turns both cases into visible states: a missing file is reported
as a missing source, and a re-cut clip shows up as a changed hash rather than an old answer
quietly describing a different video.

**Why `trim_segments` and not `trimmed_path`.** `trimmed_path` looks like the owner and is
not: `db.py` reads it once during migration and never writes it again. On this project's
database it is NULL on all 141 rows while 30 files sit in `trimmed/`; on a database created
today the column does not exist at all, so the same mistake fails silently on one machine
and crashes on another.

**Why keyframes cluster at the middle.** The cut rule is `impact ± pad`, so in a finished
shot the collision is near the centre. Reviewer-adjusted shots run 9.2–29.0s (median 16.0),
and spreading four frames evenly across the longest one puts them ~9s from the impact —
useless for a group-C question, which needs the frame just before it.

**Measured, 2026-09-05** (GTX 1660 Ti, 6144 MiB):

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| VRAM idle → model loaded | 544 → 3259 MiB (attributed by stopping the container: 532 MiB) |
| VRAM during inference | 3317 MiB, 54% of the card |
| Prompt tokens | 1 image 364 · 2 images 702 · **4 images 1378** of a 4096 context |
| Latency | 52.5s cold, then 3–7s warm |
| Determinism | `temperature=0` gives byte-identical answers across runs |

**Known limitation.** llama.cpp warns Qwen-VL wants ≥1024 image tokens for grounding tasks;
at 768px each image costs ~344. Raising `--image-min-tokens` would push 4 images past a 4096
context and need `--ctx-size 8192` plus more VRAM. Left at the default because the model
reads licence plates and shop signs correctly as configured.

**Security.** llama.cpp has no authentication and enables CORS `*` — it says so in its own
startup log. The only thing keeping it private is the `127.0.0.1` in the compose port
mapping. Do not change that to `0.0.0.0` without putting something in front of it.
